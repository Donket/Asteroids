README



	NOTE:

		I don't know in what context this document will be read, but these are my game files! 
		Full disclosure, I have not gotten to the point of optimization or refactoring in the
		process yet, so quite a bit of it is fragments of old and new code combined in a 
		fragile mess which works (if not at all efficiently) sufficiently. I started this 
		game early in my process of learning the language, and since I have come a long way,
		so some early code will be quite different in style and intelligibility than some of 
		the later code. This is my second ever (serious) game dev project, and whoever is 
		reading this, I hope you enjoy!



	GAME CREDITS:

		All code, game concept, and assets were created by myself. 



	FOR THE FUTURE:

		In the future, I hope to develop this project far more, and ideally put it up on 
		steam. The main thing I've wanted to add from the beginning is a modular system 
		where the entire rules of the game can change in a moment by purchasing Rulebook
		items. Before release, I want to finish that functionality as well as greatly 
		increasing the number of stars and asteroids in the game, and balancing.
